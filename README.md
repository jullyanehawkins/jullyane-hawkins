### Milestone 1 Feedback
Everything looks great here - your project's Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona are all appropriate and within scope. Nice touch basing your Persona on a real person. Having worked with John for a few years, I can tell you that he definitely appreciates an aesthetically pleasing and well put together portfolio, and he will certainly load the page on mobile - something to keep in mind perhaps? :-)

Your project and files are all set up to spec and your code looks great - nice work.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2&alpha;. Looking forward to seeing your content and design ideas in the next phase.
